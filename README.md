# CryptoIO
Get 32 outputs from ESP8266 boards using shift registers and I2S

This library still needs a lot of improvements and optimisations, the current version was good enough for the internet.
If you find a bug please report it, or even better - contribute a fix!

Idea taken from [Cnlohr's LED driver](https://github.com/cnlohr/esp8266ws2812i2s) and [Lhartmann's RepRap driver](https://github.com/lhartmann/esp8266_reprap).
